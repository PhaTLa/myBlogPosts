# Phạm Tùng Lâm

#### Devops Engineer

* **Location:** Ha Dong, Ha Noi City 
* **Email:** [phamtunglam.workmail.public@gmail.com](mailto:phamtunglam.workmail.public@gmail.com) 

My immediate goal is to further develop my capabilities and seek new challenges in the DevOps field, ensuring that I can contribute effectively to a dynamic team while keeping abreast of the latest technologies and methodologies. In the future, I aspire to evolve into a Solution Architect role, where I can design and implement innovative solutions on a larger scale. 


### What I'm Doing Now

Currently, I'm working as an **Application Architect at LG CNS**. In this role, I focus on designing and building robust software infrastructures on the AWS cloud for both monolithic and microservices architectures. A significant part of my day involves providing consultation and support to international customers, guiding them through the installation and management of their systems. I heavily rely on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Ansible and Terraform to automate provisioning and effectively manage core AWS services such as EKS, EC2, and ECR.

### My Technical Toolkit

I'm passionate about building and optimizing the bridges between development and operations. My expertise lies in crafting seamless **CI/CD pipelines** that fit various project needs. I have hands-on experience with a range of tools, including Jenkins, GitLab CI, TektonCI, ArgoCD, and AWS CodePipeline, to ensure code gets from commit to production smoothly and reliably.

My approach is grounded in **automation and containerization**. I'm proficient in managing infrastructure as code with Ansible and Terraform, which helps maintain consistency and control across environments. I have advanced knowledge in container technologies like Docker and orchestrating them at scale with Kubernetes, whether it's a self-managed cluster or a cloud service like Amazon EKS. This experience spans multiple platforms, from on-premise servers to the AWS cloud.

To ensure systems are not just running but are healthy and performant, I have a strong focus on **observability**. I've set up and managed comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing stacks using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Zipkin, and the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Vector). This is all supported by a solid foundation in programming with languages like Java, Python, and Bash, which allows me to script, automate, and debug effectively.
